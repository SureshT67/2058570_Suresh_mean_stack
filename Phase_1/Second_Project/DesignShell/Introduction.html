	<p>Java is a high-level programming language originally developed
		by Sun micro-systems and released in 1995. Java runs on a variety of
		platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX.
		This tutorial gives a complete understanding of Java. This reference
		will take you through simple and practical approaches while learning
		Java Programming language.</p>
	<h2>Why to learn Java Programming language?</h2>
	<p>
		Java is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a
		great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Software
		Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of
		learning Java Programming:<br /> <b> Object Oriented</b> − In Java,
		everything is an Object. Java can be easily extended since it is based
		on the Object model.<br /> <b>Platform Independent</b> − Unlike many
		other programming languages including C and C++, when Java is
		compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather
		into platform independent byte code. This byte code is distributed
		over the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever
		platform it is being run on.<br /> <b>Simple</b> − Java is designed
		to be easy to learn. If you understand the basic concept of OOP Java,
		it would be easy to master.<br /> <b>Secure</b> − With Java's secure
		feature it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free systems.
		Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.<br /> <b>Architecture-neutral</b>
		− Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format,
		which makes the compiled code executable on many processors, with the
		presence of Java runtime system.<br /> <b>Portable</b> − Being
		architecture-neutral and having no implementation dependent aspects of
		the specification makes Java portable. Compiler in Java is written in
		ANSI C with a clean portability boundary, which is a POSIX subset.<br />
		<b>Robust</b> − Java makes an effort to eliminate error prone
		situations by emphasizing mainly on compile time error checking and
		runtime checking.
